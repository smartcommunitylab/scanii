          >. Please note that this assistance does not include legal aid, for
          which appropriate application must be made under national law; nor
          does it include a legal assessment of your case. Language: You should
          reply to the claim in the language of the court/tribunal which has
          sent you this form.

          <br /><br />

          Oral hearing: Please note that the European Small Claims Procedure is
          a written procedure. However the court may decide to have an oral
          hearing if it considers that it is not possible to give the judgment
          on the basis of written evidence. You can request, in this form or at
          a later stage, that an oral hearing be held. The court may refuse your
          request if it considers, in the light of the circumstances of the
          case, that an oral hearing is not necessary for the fair conduct of
          the proceedings. The oral hearing should be carried out through
          appropriate distance communication means, like videoconference or
          teleconference, provided that they are available to the court. If the
          person to be heard is domiciled in a Member State other than that of
          the court seised, a hearing by distance communication technology shall
          be arranged by making use of the procedures provided for in Council
          Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001<br />(<img

            >https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_taking_of_evidence-76-en.do</a
          >)<br />However the court may decide that the persons summoned for the
          hearing must be physically present. You can indicate your preferences
          to the court, bearing in mind, that if you requested to be physically
          present at the hearing, the recovery of any costs incurred with regard
          to this presence is subject to the rules of Article 16 of Regulation
          (EC) No 861/2007 establishing a European Small Claims Procedure. This
          Article stipulates that the court shall not award to the successful
          party costs that were unnecessarily incurred or are disproportionate
          to the claim.

          <br /><br />

          Supporting documents: You can indicate possible means of evidence, and
          add, where appropriate, supporting documents.
          <br /><br />

          Correcting your details: You can also correct or supplement
          information about yourself (e.g. contact details, representative etc.)
          in section 6 ‘Other information’.
          <br /><br />

          Service of documents and communication with the court: Procedural
          documents, like your response and the judgment may be served upon the
          parties by post or by electronic means, if such means are technically
          available to the court and admissible in accordance with the
          procedural law of the Member State in which the procedure is
          conducted. If the documents are to be served in a Member State other
          than the one in which the procedure is conducted, the procedural rules
          of the Member State where service is to be effected have to be
          observed as well. Electronic means could be used also for other
          written communications (e.g. a request to attend a court hearing).
          Electronic means can be used only if the addressee expressly consents
          in advance to their use or if he/she is legally obliged to accept
          electronic service and/or other written communication from the court
          in accordance with the procedural rules of the Member State in which
          the addressee is domiciled. To see if electronic means of service
          and/or communication are available and admissible in the relevant
          Member States check the information on the European e-justice portal
