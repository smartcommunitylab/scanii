Please note that it is not mandatory to be represented by a lawyer or another legal professional. It may not be sufficient in some countries to give only a PO Box as the address and you should therefore include the street name and number with a postcode. Failure to do so may result in the document not being served. ‘Other details’ may contain information that helps to identify you, for example, your date of birth, occupation, position in the company. Where there is more than one claimant, please use additional sheets.",
