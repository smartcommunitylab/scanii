          "simplifiedText": "The European Small Claims Procedure is a written procedure. You can request an oral hearing, but the court may refuse if it's not necessary for the fair conduct of proceedings. If the person to be heard is in another Member State, distance communication technology (e.g. videoconference or teleconference) will be used unless the court decides that they must be physically present at the hearing. Costs incurred with regard to physical presence are subject to rules on proportionality and necessity.",
